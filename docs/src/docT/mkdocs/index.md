### mkDocs and how to use it
This product wad build using mkdocs. If youre unfamilliar with mkdocs dont't worry. 

MkDocs is used to provide some functonality to this project. It allows users to be able to view this book online or alternativly create a PDF version of it for more comfortable reading while offline. Additionally it allows users to "host" a "local instance" of the documentation platform from their onw computer. This i a facny way of saying youre crating a fake web page in your broweser. 

What this allows developers to do is make sure everyting is displayed and functioning as it is intended to to before making the platform live for the world to see. We dont expect you to be doing any developing but it does offer a neat nieche for wieving the platform offline, as if it was online. 

For anyone interested please follow this sections instructions.
